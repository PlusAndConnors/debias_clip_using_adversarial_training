=> Learning similarity loss with feature augmentation using CE loss for PGD [Positive Term]
=> Announcement: Learning similarity, which causes mis-classifier
-> [Learning CE if the original is wrong, learning similarity if the aggressor is wrong, KD if the attack fails]


16: img augmentation using tuned txt model
17: Tune the augmented one for img model => [CE if wrong, similarity if attack is wrong, KD if all is right]
18: View Img Performance => ck performance [ck]


----
19: txt augmentation using tuned img model
20: txt model tuning again (10 epoch)
21: fix loss function
22: fix number of repetitions [epoch per collaboration]
23: Experiment confirmed
24: Preparing for the presentation [with performance]
25: Announcement
